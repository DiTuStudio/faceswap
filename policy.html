          <h2>Welcome to Morphify’s Privacy Policy!</h2>
          <p>
            If you decide not to read this entire Privacy Policy, we want you to
            walk away with a few key points about Morphify’s privacy practices:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The Apps are photo or video editors that allow users to swap
              portraits with highly realistic facial transformations.
            </li>
            <li>
              We do not use photographs or videos you provide when you use the
              Apps for any reason other than to provide you with the swapping
              functionality of the Apps.
            </li>
            <li>
              We use third-party cloud providers — specifically, Digital Ocean —
              to store photographs and videos.
            </li>
            <li>
              You only send to the cloud the photographs or videos that you
              specifically select for swapping and editting.
            </li>
            <li>
              Photographs or videos are temporarily cached on the cloud servers
              during the swapping process, and encrypted using a key stored
              locally on your mobile device.
            </li>
            <li>
              Photographs may remain lifetime in the cloud, videos may remain in
              the cloud for a maximum limited period of 24 hours, for improved
              performance and lower bandwidth allowing additional changes to
              recently selected photos or videos in an optimal manner.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Here’s more on our privacy practices.</p>
          <h2 class="c-page-title-2 mt-5 mt-md-8 mt-md-10">
            1. Information We Collect
          </h2>
          <p>
            1.1. When you use the App and select photographs or videos for
            swapping, we cache them for processing to render the requested
            swapping service:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong
                >Photographs or videos you select when you use the Apps</strong
              >, via your camera or camera roll (if you have granted the Apps
              the permission to access your camera or camera roll). We process
              only specific photos and videos you choose to modify using the
              Apps; and we do not collect your photo or video albums even if you
              grant us access to them. We safeguard each photograph or video
              that you select using an encryption key stored locally on your
              device. This means that the only device that can view the photo or
              video is the device from which the photograph or video was
              submitted using the Apps – the user’s device. Please note that
              while we do not require or request any metadata attached to the
              photographs or videos you select for swapping, metadata
              (including, for example, geotags) may be associated with your
              photographs or videos by default. We take steps to delete any
              metadata that may be associated with a photograph or video you
              provide when you use the Apps. Photographs may remain lifetime in
              the cloud, videos may remain in the cloud for a maximum limited
              period of 24 hours after your last swap or edit, so that you can
              return to it and make additional changes if you so choose.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            1.2. When you use the App, we may collect some information,
            including:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>App usage information and online activity data</strong>,
              such as information about how you use the App and interact with
              it, including the features you use, your preferred language, the
              date and time when you first installed the App and the date and
              time when you launch the app; Our service providers and certain
              third parties (e.g., online advertising networks and their
              clients) also may collect this type of information over time and
              across third-party websites and mobile applications. We may
              collect this information directly or through our use of
              third-party software development kits (“SDKs”). SDKs may enable
              third parties to collect information directly from the App.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Device data</strong>, such as your mobile device operating
              system type and version number, manufacturer and model, push
              tokens, Google Advertising ID and Apple ID for Advertising.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>1.3. When you contact us by email, we may also collect:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Contact information</strong>, such as your name and email
              address, and information relating to your communication.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2 class="c-page-title-2 mt-5 mt-md-8 mt-md-10">
            2. How We Use Your Information
          </h2>
          <p>
            2.1. We do not use photographs or videos you provide when you use
            the Apps for any reason other than to provide you with the swapping
            functionality of the Apps.
          </p>
          <p>
            2.2. We may use information other than photographs and videos for
            the following purposes:
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>To operate and improve the Apps.</strong> We use your
            personal information to operate, maintain, and provide you with the
            Apps. In particular, we will use your personal information to
            perform our contractual obligations under our Terms of Use, such as
            to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Enable you to use the Apps’ features.</li>
            <li>
              Communicate with you about the Apps, including by sending you
              announcements (if you chose to “share email address”), updates,
              and security alerts, which we may send through a push
              notification, and responding to your requests, questions, and
              feedback.
            </li>
            <li>Provide technical support and maintenance for the Apps.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>To improve, monitor, and protect our Apps</strong>. It is in
            our legitimate business interests to improve and keep our services
            safe and secure for our users. We do this by:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Performing statistical analysis on aggregated data relating to the
              use of the Apps(including through the use of third-party
              services).
            </li>
            <li>Troubleshooting, testing, and researching.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>To display advertisements to you.</strong> If you use the
            free version of the Apps, we work with advertising partners to
            display advertisements within the Apps. These advertisements are
            delivered by our advertising partners and may be targeted based on
            your online activity. Where require under applicable law, we process
            your personal information based on your consent for these purposes,
            which you may withdraw at any time. Otherwise we process your
            personal information for advertising purposes where it is in our
            legitimate interests to do so.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>For compliance, fraud prevention, and safety.</strong> We
            may use and disclose the information we collect (such as device data
            and app usage information) where it is in our legitimate business
            interests to: (a) protect our, your, or others’ rights, privacy,
            safety, or property (including by making and defending legal
            claims); (b) enforce the terms and conditions that govern the Apps;
            and (c) protect, investigate, and deter against fraudulent, harmful,
            unauthorized, unethical, or illegal activity. We may disclose this
            information to government authorities and other third parties as
            required by applicable law. We cannot disclose the photos and videos
            that have been cached for processing as we do not store the
            encryption keys.

          </p>
          <p>
            2.3. We will only process personal information on the basis of our
            legitimate interests where such interests are not overridden by your

            3. How We Share Your Information
          </h2>
          <p>
            3.1. We do not disclose user photographs or videos to third parties
            (with the exception of temporarily caching an encrypted version with
            our cloud providers, Digital Ocean, to provide the photo and video
            swapping features of the Apps). We cannot share the photos and
            videos cached for processing as we do not store the encryption keys.
          </p>
          <p>
            3.2. We may share your non-photograph and non-video information in
            the following circumstances:
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Service providers.</strong> We may share your information
            with service providers that perform services on our behalf or help
            us operate the Apps (such as customer support, hosting, analytics,
            email delivery, marketing, and database management services). These
            third parties may use your information only as directed or
            authorized by us and in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy
            and are prohibited from using or disclosing your information for any
            other purpose.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Advertising partners.</strong> When third-party cookies and
            other tracking tools are used, our advertising partners may collect
            information from your device to display advertisements on the Apps,
            and to advertise the Apps (and related content) elsewhere online.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Third-party platforms and social media networks.</strong>
            You may select to post the swapped photograph or swapped video to
            your social media account. We do not control the third-party
            platforms’ use of your information, which is governed by that third
            party’s privacy policy and terms and conditions.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Professional advisors.</strong> We may disclose your
            information to professional advisors, such as lawyers and auditors,
            where necessary in the course of the professional services that they
            render to us.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Business transfers.</strong> We may sell, transfer, or
            otherwise share some or all of our business or assets, including
            information, in connection with a business transaction (or potential
            business transaction) such as a corporate divestiture, merger,
            consolidation, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of assets, or in
            the event of bankruptcy or dissolution.
          </p>
          <h2 class="c-page-title-2 mt-5 mt-md-8 mt-md-10">
            4. Compliance with Law
          </h2>
          <p>
            We may be required to disclose your information to comply with
            applicable laws, lawful requests, and legal process, such as to
            respond to subpoenas or requests from government authorities, or for
            the compliance, fraud prevention, and safety reasons described
            above. We do not have any access to your photos or videos as they
            are cached in encrypted format, and the key resides on the user’s
            device so we cannot disclose such content.
          </p>
          <h2 class="c-page-title-2 mt-5 mt-md-8 mt-md-10">5. Your Choices</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Opt out of local notifications.</strong> You may opt out of
            the local notifications we may send you by changing the settings on
            your mobile device.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Device permissions.</strong> You may revoke any permissions
            you previously granted to us, such as permission to access your
            camera, camera roll, or microphone through the settings on your
            mobile device.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Personal information requests.</strong> We also offer you
            choices that affect how we handle the personal information that we
            control. Depending on your jurisdiction, you may request the

            <li>
              <strong>Additional rights</strong>, such as to<strong

            have requested, or our ability to comply with our legal obligations
            and enforce our legal rights. If you are not satisfied with how we
            address your request, you may submit a complaint by contacting us as

          </h2>
          <p>
            The App may contain links to other websites, mobile applications,
            and other online services operated by third parties. These links are
            not an endorsement of, or representation that we are affiliated
            with, any third party. In addition, our content may be included on
            web pages or in mobile applications or online services that are not
            associated with us. We do not control third party websites, mobile
            applications, or online services, and we are not responsible for
            their actions. Other websites, mobile applications, and online
            services follow different rules regarding the collection, use, and
            sharing of your personal information. We encourage you to read the
            privacy policies of the other websites, mobile applications, and
            online services you use.

            7. Security Practices
          </h2>
          <p>
            We use commercially reasonable security practices to help keep the
            information collected through our services secure. However, Morphify
            cannot guarantee the security of any information you provide, as bad
            actors, for example, may try to access, disclosure, alter, or
            destroy your information.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please do your part to help us. You are responsible for maintaining
            the confidentiality of your information, and for controlling access
            to communications between you and Morphify, at all times. We are not
            responsible for the functionality, privacy, or security measures of
            any other organization.

          <h2 class="c-page-title-2 mt-5 mt-md-8 mt-md-10">8. Retention</h2>
          <p>
            We configure Digital Ocean to delete photographs and videos, and the
            information associated with those photographs and videos, within 24
            hours with video and lifetime with photographs after the photograph
            or video was last swapped using the Apps. This allows you to revisit
            photographs or videos to make additional modifications during that
            time.
          </p>
          <p>
            With respect to non-photograph and non-video information that we may
            collect, we will retain such information only for as long as
            necessary to fulfill the purposes we have set out in this Privacy
            Policy. You may delete your information using the
            <strong>“Delete Account”</strong> option in the “Profile” section of
            the App.

            9. Cross-Border Data Transfers
          </h2>
          <p>
            If we transfer your personal information internationally, these
            countries may not provide the same protections as the data
            protection laws where you are based. Where we transfer information
            internationally, we:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Make sure the data transfer complies with applicable law; and
            </li>
            <li>
              Make sure that the relevant safeguards are in place to afford
              adequate protection for your personal information.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We do this using a variety of protections, as appropriate for each
            data transfer. For example, we use:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Standard Contractual Clauses (or an alternative legal tool, such
              as the UK Government-approved International Data Transfer
              Agreement or Addendum) to require the third party to protect your
              data and to provide you with EU- and UK-level rights and
              protections;
            </li>
            <li>
              Technical protections, such as automated deletion, encryption, and
              pseudonymization; and
            </li>
            <li>
              Policies and processes to challenge disproportionate or unlawful
              government authority requests.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Note, our technical support team may also access your information,
            such as App usage information, in locations outside of your state,
            province, or country.
          </p>
          <h2 class="c-page-title-2 mt-5 mt-md-8 mt-md-10">10. Children</h2>
          <p>
            Our Apps are not directed at children under the age of 13. This
            explains why we do not consciously collect data from subjects under
            the age of 13. If you are less than 13 years old, do not use our
            Apps. If you are a parent or the guardian of a person under the age
            of 13, please do not allow such person to use our Apps. In certain
            cases, this age may be higher than 13 due to local regulatory
            requirements.
          </p>

            11. Changes to the Privacy Policy
          </h2>
          <p>
            We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. If
            we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you
            by updating the date of this Privacy Policy and posting it on the
            App. We may, and if required by law will, provide notification of
            changes in another way that we believe is reasonably likely to reach
            you, such as through the Apps.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any modifications to this Privacy Policy will be effective upon our
            posting the new terms or upon implementation of the new changes on
            the Apps (or as otherwise indicated at the time of posting). In all
            cases, your continued use of our services after the posting of any
            modified Privacy Policy indicates your acceptance of the terms of
            the modified Privacy Policy.
