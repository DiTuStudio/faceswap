        12A. BINDING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT – UNITED STATES USERS
      </h3>
      <p>
        IF YOU ARE LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES, THIS SECTION 12A OF THE
        AGREEMENT CONTAINS PROVISIONS GOVERNING HOW DISPUTES THAT YOU AND WE
        HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER ARE RESOLVED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
        DISPUTES THAT AROSE OR WERE ASSERTED PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS
        AGREEMENT. IN PARTICULAR, IT CONTAINS AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WHICH
        WILL, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS, REQUIRE DISPUTES BETWEEN US TO BE
        SUBMITTED TO BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION. UNLESS YOU OPT OUT OF THE
        ARBITRATION AGREEMENT: (1) YOU WILL ONLY BE PERMITTED TO PURSUE DISPUTES
        OR CLAIMS AND SEEK RELIEVE AGAINST US ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, NOT AS A
        PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR
        PROCEEDING; AND (2) YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO PURSUE DISPUTES OR
        CLAIMS AND SEEK RELIEF IN A COURT OF LAW AND TO HAVE A JURY TRIAL.
      </p>
      <p>
        IF YOU ARE LOCATED IN THE UK OR THE EU, THIS SECTION 12A DOES NOT APPLY
        TO YOU, AND DISPUTES YOU AND WE HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER WILL BE RESOLVED
        IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 12B BELOW.
      </p>
      <p>
        IF YOU ARE LOCATED OUTSIDE OF THE US, THE UK OR THE EU, THIS SECTION 12A
        DOES NOT APPLY TO YOU, AND DISPUTES YOU AND WE HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER
        WILL BE RESOLVED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 12C BELOW.
      </p>
      <p>
        ANY DISPUTE, CLAIM OR REQUEST FOR RELIEF RELATING IN ANY WAY TO YOUR USE
        OF THE SITE WILL BE GOVERNED AND INTERPRETED BY AND UNDER THE LAWS OF
        THE REPUBLIC OF CYPRUS, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ANY PRINCIPLES THAT
        PROVIDE FOR THE APPLICATION OF THE LAW OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION. THE
        UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF
        GOODS IS EXPRESSLY EXCLUDED FROM THE AGREEMENT.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please read the following section carefully because it requires users to
        arbitrate certain disputes and claims with Morphify and limits the
        manner in which you can seek relief from us.
      </p>
      <p>
        Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. Except for small claims disputes
        in which you or Morphify seek to bring an individual action in small
        claims court located in the county of your billing address or disputes
        in which you or Morphify seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for
        the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, you and Morphify
        waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any dispute arising out of
        or related to this Agreement or our Services resolved in court. This
        Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all disputes
        or claims and requests for relief that arose or were asserted before the
        effective date of this Agreement or any prior version of this Agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Arbitration Rules and Forum. To begin an arbitration proceeding, you
        must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your dispute or
        claim or request for relief to
        <strong
          ><a href="mailto:izidev2023@gmail.com"
            >izidev2023@gmail.com</a
          ></strong
        >. The arbitration will be resolved through confidential binding
        arbitration by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (“JAMS”),
        an established alternative dispute resolution provider. Disputes
        involving claims, counterclaims, or requests for relief under 250,000
        EURO, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, shall be subject to
        JAMS’s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and
        procedures available; all other disputes shall be subject to JAMS’s most
        current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures,
        available at
        <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/adr-rules-procedures/"
          >https://www.jamsadr.com/adr-rules-procedures/</a
        >. JAMS’s rules are also available at
        <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/">www.jamsadr.com</a> or by calling
        JAMS at 1-800-352-5267. If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the
        parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. If the arbitrator
        finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMS’s filing, administrative,
        hearing and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, Morphify
        will pay them for you. In addition, we will reimburse all such JAMS’s
        filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees for disputes, claims,
        or requests for relief totaling less than 10,000 Euro unless the
        arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on
        written submissions or at another mutually agreed location. Any judgment
        on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of
        competent jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Authority of Arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority
        to (a) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration
        Agreement and (b) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation,
        applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration
        Agreement, including, but not limited to, any assertion that all or any
        part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitration
        will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Morphify. The
        arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters
        or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the
        authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The
        arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to
        grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under
        applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and the Agreement (including
        the Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator shall issue a written award
        and statement of decision describing the essential findings and
        conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of
        any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award
        relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.
        The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.
      </p>
      <p>
        Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND Morphify HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL
        AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A
        JUDGE OR A JURY. You and Morphify are instead electing that all
        disputes, claims or requests for relief shall be resolved by arbitration
        under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified above. An
        arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief
        as a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would. However,
        there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an
        arbitration award is subject to very limited review.
      </p>
      <p>
        Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief. ALL DISPUTES, CLAIMS
        AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT
        MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS OR
        COLLECTIVE BASIS. ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF
        MORE THAN ONE USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF
        ANY OTHER USER. If a decision is issued stating that applicable law
        precludes enforcement of any of this subsection’s limitations as to a
        given dispute, claim or request for relief, then such aspect must be
        severed from the arbitration and brought into the courts of the Republic
        of Cyprus. All other disputes, claims, or requests for relief shall be
        arbitrated.
      </p>
      <p>
        30-Day Right to Opt-Out. You have the right to opt out of the provisions
        of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision
        to opt-out to:
        <strong
          ><a href="mailto:izidev2023@gmail.com"

          ></strong
        >, within 30 days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration
        Agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, and an
        unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration
        Agreement. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts
        of this Agreement will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this
        Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements
        that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.
      </p>
      <p>
        You and Morphify agree that the courts of the Republic of Cyprus have
        exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an
        arbitration award.
      </p>

        or restricted under the terms of the Distribution Channels. Each
        instance of the Agreement that you agree to in connection with

        Services, you agree to comply with all applicable terms of any agreement

          understand and agree that in accordance with this Agreement, Morphify
          has disclaimed all warranties of any kind with respect to the Apps,

          rights, Morphify, and not Apple, will be solely responsible for the
